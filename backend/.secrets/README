This is a *temporary* arrangement to get gsheets support working while
we also actively change the resource server API and implement the necessary
changes to the UI.

To test gsheets support, download you service account .json secrets file
and move it to this location. And then in `.env.conduit-integrations` set
`CONDUIT_SERVICE_API_KEY` to the name of this file; do not include the path!

REMEMBER to not commit the json file itself!!! The .gitignore file has been
setup to ignore *.json files in this folder.
